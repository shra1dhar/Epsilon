<!-- First part of answer:
Pandora's box is an artifact in Greek mythology, taken from the myth of Pandora in Hesiod's Works and Days. The container
mentioned in the original story is actually a large storage jar but the word was later mistranslated as "box". In modern
times an idiom has grown from it meaning “Any source of great and unexpected troubles”, or alternatively “A present which
seems valuable but which in reality is a curse”. Later artistic treatments of the fatal container have been very varied,
while some literary treatments have focused more on the contents of the idiomatic box than on Pandora herself.
According to Hesiod, when Prometheus stole fire from heaven, Zeus, the king of the gods, took vengeance by presenting Pandora
to Prometheus' brother Epimetheus. Pandora opened a jar left in his care containing death and many other evils which were
then released into the world. She hastened to close the container, but the whole contents had escaped except for one thing
that lay at the bottom – usually translated as Hope, though it could also have the pessimistic meaning of “deceptive expectation".
From this story has grown the idiom “to open (a) Pandora’s box”, meaning to do or start something that will cause many unforeseen
problems. Its modern, more colloquial equivalent is "to open a can of worms".

Second part of answer:
The word now translated as "box" was actually a large jar (pithos) in the Greek. It was used for storage of
wine, oil, grain or other provisions, or, ritually, as a container for a human body for burying, from which it was believed
souls escaped and necessarily returned. Many scholars see a close analogy between Pandora herself, who was made from clay,
and the clay jar which dispenses evils. The mistranslation of pithos is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist
Erasmus who, in his Latin account of the story of Pandora, changed the Greek pithos to pyxis, meaning "box". The context
in which the story appeared was Erasmus’ collection of proverbs, the Adagia (1508), in illustration of the Latin saying Malo
accepto stultus sapit (from experiencing trouble a fool is made wise). In his version the box is opened by Epimetheus, whose
name means ‘Afterthought’ - or as Hesiod comments, “he whom mistakes made wise”.

Third part of answer:
Later in the 16th century, two Venetian artists designed prints of the story of the box that focussed on its allegorical
meaning. In that by Paolo Farinati, dated between 1584/94, Epimetheus has lifted the lid from (in this case) the jar that
Pandora is holding. Out of it boils a cloud which carries up a man and a dragon; between them they support a scroll reading
“sero nimirum sapere caepit”. Its message, ‘finding out too late’, is reminiscent of the proverb recorded by Erasmus, Malo
accepto stultus sapit.
The other print is ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro (active 1565 – 1586) and is much more enigmatic. Usually titled “Pandora’s
Box, or The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit”, it portrays a woman in antique dress opening an ornate coffer from
which spill books, manuscripts, snakes and bats. By Pandora’s side is a woman carrying a burning brand, while a horned figure
flees in the opposite direction. Above is a curved vault painted with signs of the zodiac to which the sun-god Apollo is
pointing, while opposite him another figure falls through the stars. Commentators ascribe different meanings to these symbols
as contradictory as the contents of the chest. In one reading, the hand Pandora holds up to her face makes her the figure
of Ignorance.[14] Alternatively her eyes are protected because she is dazzled and the snakes crawling from the chest are
ancient symbols of wisdom.[15] Apollo, seated above, points to Aquarius, the zodiacal sign of January/February, which marks
the “Ascent of the Sun” from the trough of winter. The falling figure opposite him may be identified either as Lucifer or
as night fleeing before the dawn; in either case, the darkness of ignorance is about to be dispelled. The question remains
whether the box thus opened will in the end be recognised as a blessing; whether the ambiguous nature of knowledge is either
to help or to hurt. In later centuries the emphasis in art has generally been on the person of Pandora. With few exceptions
the box has appeared merely as her attribute. René Magritte’s street scene of 1951, however, one of the few modern paintings
to carry the title “Pandora’s Box”, is as enigmatic as were the Renaissance allegorical prints.
And do you know the best part. The best part is to gain that sadistic pleasure devoid of any salvation and imagining your face from here.
The answer ain't here SUCKER !

Two poems in English dealing with Pandora’s opening of the box are in the form of monologues, although Frank Sayers preferred
the term monodrama for his recitation with lyrical interludes, written in 1790. In this Pandora is descending from Heaven
after being endowed with gifts by the gods and therefore feels empowered to open the casket she carries, releasing strife,
care, pride, hatred and despair. Only the voice of Hope is left to comfort her at the end. -->
